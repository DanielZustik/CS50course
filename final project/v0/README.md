#### Description: video game in Lua via LOVE2D framework

##### Introduction: For my final project I ve decided to create a little game in Lua via LOVE2D framework. I had to taught myself how to write in Lua langugage. I did it so by great step by step tutorial on Sheepolution "How to Love". I have went through all the chapters and practice everything that was there. In the final chpater "Platformer" I have created simple platformer game demo... simple but with all the important mechanics like collision detection/resolution, gravity, anamations, clases and so on. So this final chapter was stepping stone into my own game...
##### deciding on basic concept: I was deciding on basic parameters of my game for long time, I wasnt sure if i want a game from top-down perspective something in style of io.games or little more chalanging thing - platformer. I ve decided for later... because I though it will bring out more feauters and possibilities than top-down game. So many things "work" in a game: u can run as u wish, jump, gravity pulls u down, u stay on platform (if u dont actually fall of it), u can jump over obsticles or enemy, u can pick up objects. There is quite neat visiual look to a game (I have dowloaded free tile set and texture for characters, objects and also background... all in cyberpunk style)
##### development phase: so as I mentioned I have started building my game on top of the code from final chapter "How to Love". I have added another types of objects like card, chest. I have also added another "player" like entity Enemy. I had to modifie few things in all the files eg.
