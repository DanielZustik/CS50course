# CS50 Projects Repository

## About
This repository contains my projects developed during the CS50 course at Harvard Extension School. CS50 is an introductory course to computer science, covering a broad range of topics including algorithms, data structures, software engineering, and web development. I have successfully completed the course and received a verified certificate.

## Course Syllabus
For a detailed understanding of the course structure and content covered each week, please refer to the [CS50 Course Syllabus](<Link_to_Syllabus>).

## Projects Overview
The projects in this repository are a mix of assignments I worked on throughout the course. Approximately half of these projects are written in C, showcasing foundational programming concepts and low-level programming skills. The other half includes projects in Python, demonstrating more advanced programming concepts, web scraping, and data manipulation. Additionally, the repository features projects involving HTML, CSS, and SQL, highlighting web development skills and database management.
